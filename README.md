# Rust-book

This repository involves tips and tricks to learn the Rust in the easiest way possible. I've referred various books, documentations and curated this path to learn Rust concepts.

Let's start, there are few places from where you can learn Rust but I would recommend the [Rust Book by Brown University.](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) which includes quizzes along with the same concepts as in the [official doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) and [Rust By Practice](https://practice.course.rs/why-exercise.html).
