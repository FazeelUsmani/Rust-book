# Rust-book

There are few places from where you can learn Rust but I would recommend the [Rust Book by Brown University.](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)

## Other resources

* [Rust By Example - The official Rust doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)
* [Rust By Practice](https://practice.course.rs/why-exercise.html)
* [Rust RFC Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/introduction.html)
